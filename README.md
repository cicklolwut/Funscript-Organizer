## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Native Host (for file renaming on disk)

1. Navigate to the `native-host` directory:
   ```bash
   cd native-host
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Make the Python script executable
   - Install the native messaging host manifest to Firefox's directory
   - Set up the communication channel between the extension and your system

### Step 2: Install the Extension

1. First, create the extension icons:
   - Open `create-icons.html` in a browser
   - Right-click each canvas and save as:
     - `icon-16.png`
     - `icon-48.png`
     - `icon-128.png`

2. Install in Firefox:
   - Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox"
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file

## Usage

### Basic Operation
1. The extension automatically tracks downloads of:
   - `.funscript` files (including variants like `.funscript.twist`)
   - Video files (`.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.wmv`, `.flv`, `.m4v`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`)

2. Files with matching base names are automatically removed from the list

3. Click the extension icon to view unmatched files in two columns

### File Management

#### Smart Rename with Match Probability
1. **Hover** over any file to see action buttons
2. Click the **arrow button** (‚Üí or ‚Üê) to start rename mode with that file as the base
3. **View intelligent match suggestions**:
   - Files automatically sorted by match probability (best matches first)
   - **Color-coded confidence indicators**:
     - üü¢ **Green (80%+)**: High confidence matches
     - üü† **Orange (50-79%)**: Possible matches
     - üî¥ **Red (<50%)**: Low confidence matches
4. Click any file in the target list to rename it
5. Successfully renamed files will automatically match and be removed

#### Smart Matching Algorithm
The extension uses advanced algorithms to identify matching files:
- **Keyword extraction**: Removes technical metadata, brackets, creator tags
- **Content analysis**: Focuses on character names, series, and meaningful content words
- **Source context**: Considers download page titles for additional matching hints
- **Flexible matching**: Handles different filename conventions (e.g., `[Creator] Series - Character` vs `character-scene-creator-quality`)
- **Multi-factor scoring**: Combines filename similarity, keyword matches, timing, and source context

#### Remove Files
- Click the **√ó button** on any file to manually remove it from tracking

#### Clear Matched
- Click "Clear Matched" to force re-check and remove any matched pairs

### Window Modes

## Requirements

- Firefox 50.0 or higher
- Python 3 (for native file renaming)
- Linux/Unix system (scripts may need adjustment for Windows)

## Troubleshooting

### Native Host Not Working
1. Check the log file at `~/.funscript_rename_host.log`
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
3. Restart Firefox after installing the native host
4. Verify the manifest is in: `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`

### Extension Not Tracking Downloads
1. Check that the extension has the necessary permissions
2. Ensure you're downloading actual files (not viewing them in browser)
3. Check the browser console for error messages

## Security Note

The native host has file system access to rename files. It only operates on files that Firefox has downloaded and only performs rename operations within the same directory.

## Uninstallation

### Remove Native Host
```bash
cd native-host
./uninstall.sh
```

### Remove Extension
1. Go to `about:addons` in Firefox
2. Find "Funscript Download Tracker"
3. Click Remove
